## Git workflow

Create a branch for your task, and send a pull request (PR) to `next` when you want your work reviewed and merged/rebased.

If youâ€™re adding an urgent bug fix, then code review is not required.

* The `main` branch is the released branch
* The `next` branch is the development branch

## Publishing

To release updated packages, run this command:

```sh
# To publish a new `latest` release
git checkout main
yarn release:latest

# To publish a new `next` release
git checkout next
yarn release:next
```
