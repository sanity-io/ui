# Sanity UI

_This is a work in progress_

## Storybook guidelines

- All stories must export either a named `Default` or `Basic` story.
- Avoid creating custom titles for stories - these should be inferred via folder structure alone.
- Where possible, stories should be kept as simple as possible with minimal custom / presentational props.
- Prefer setting component values via storybook [args](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/args) instead of passing them manually in props.

## Things to note

- All stories are wrapped with a [common decorator](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators#story-decorators) which wraps stories in both a `<ThemeProvider>` but also a `<Card>` with padding. This may change in future.

## Areas of improvement

- Scheme (dark / light mode) toggles should be removed on non-applicable pages (such as non-story pages like this one).
- We may want to reconsider whether scheme toggling impacts the 'manager' (or general interface) as well.
- This Storybook should not load the Nunito Sans font, which is not being used in this current theme.
- Custom components in _unattached_ MDX docs need to be wrapped with an `<Unstyled>` [component](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/doc-block-unstyled) to ensure they render correctly. (There may be a more idiomatic way to have custom components ignore MDX text styles).
