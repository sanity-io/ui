"@sanity/themer": minor

Introduce `@sanity/themer`, the npm migration path off the hosted Themer service (themer.sanity.build): `@sanity/themer/legacy` is a drop-in replacement for `https://themer.sanity.build/api/hues` URL imports — same `createTheme`/`hues`/`theme` exports, presets and generated colors, plus `buildThemeFromUrl` to migrate an existing URL import in one line.
