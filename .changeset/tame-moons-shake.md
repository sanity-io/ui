'@sanity/themer': minor
---

Add a root `buildTheme` export that generates a Studio theme from a handful of colors — `accent` (required), `text`, `background.dark`/`background.light` and `contrast` — by replacing the `@sanity/color` palette that `buildTheme` from `@sanity/ui/theme` otherwise uses. Called with the stock colors it reproduces the stock theme exactly. `buildPalette` exposes the generated palette on its own, and `presets` ships the hosted Themer service presets translated to the new options. The `themerTool` Studio plugin now edits and previews these themes instead of the legacy ones (the `/legacy` subpath is unchanged).
