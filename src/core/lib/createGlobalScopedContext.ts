/**
 * As `@sanity/ui` is declared as a dependency, and may be duplicated, sometimes across major versions
 * it's critical that vital react contexts are shared even when there is a duplicate.
 * If we used a model similar to `sanity` itself, or `styled-components`, this would be unnecessary as
 * those libraries enforce single instances.
 * Since we don't enforce it we have to support a sanity plugin being able to call hooks like `useToast`, and then
 * read the context setup by `sanity`, which calls `ToastProvider`, even if the provider and hook are different instances in memory.
 * It's also why it's vital that all changes to globally scoped providers remain fully backwards compatible to v1.
